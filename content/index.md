**Hey, I'm Shariq Ali**, I started as a software engineer in 2020, working with Laravel. I'm the **Co-Founder & CTO** of [[The Medici Project]]. Before that, I was the lead developer at [[BCCNY]] and a software engineer at [[Loop Media]] & [[Family Promise Spokane]]. I'm originally from Guyana, having moved here at a young age and settling in **New York** for the past two decades.

**I love CLI apps**, open source, and [[Projects|side projects]]. When I'm not working, I like biking, reading, and **eating tacos**.
