<a href="https://discovery-trail.shariqapps.dev" target="_blank">Discovery Trail</a> is an AI powered course generation platform where can create multiple courses for yourself or choose to share them with friends. I'm often required to do moderate-depth research on a variety of topics and developing initial context always consumes the most time; this application addresses exactly that.

This project was also an experiment using [[HATEOS]] with a Go web server. I'm weary of the unnecessary boilerplate and complexity in modern client-heavy frameworks, so I leaned heavily into hypermedia as an ***engine*** with the use of [[HTMX]]. You can view the repository <a href="https://github.com/shariqali-dev/discovery-trail" target="_blank">here</a>.
