<a href="https://www.familypromiseofspokane.org/" target="_blank">Family Promise of Spokane</a> helps local communities address the root causes of family homelessness. They provide prevention services for families in crisis, shelter & case management when they become homeless, and stabilization programs once they have secured housing to ensure they remain independent. 

I apprenticed as a Team Product Manager & Software Engineer alongside a team of hardworking developers, UI/UX designers, and data scientists to build the case management software. We met with the stakeholder weekly and scoped sprints structuring the stack architecture, accessibility, state management, and app functionality.

## Accomplishments
- Refactored vanilla application to React, optimizing data handling and 4x the teamâ€™s ability to ship code.
- Scoped agile sprints, assigning tickets, scheduling meets with a remote, distributed cross-functional team of 5.
- Arbitrated stakeholders meetings weekly to iterate on features and designs to their exact specification.
- Prioritized client accessibility and patient confidentiality when designing CMS to ensure no regulatory risks.
