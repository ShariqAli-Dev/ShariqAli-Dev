<a href="https://medici.ai" target="_none">The Medici Project</a> offers a simplistic solution to digital asset investing with a new kind of transparency. As a result of being built on [[Web3]], you can see every funds' move and decision, all clearly logged on the [[Blockchain|blockchain]].

As the Co-Founder & CTO, I work closely with my <a target="_blank" href="https://medici.ai/team">co-founders & advisors</a> to ensure the product's success. By nature of a startup, I wear multiple hats, extending my role beyond just coding. I drive the development of key features, architect our software solutions, and oversee all aspects of the project.

## Accomplishments
- Created a system covering point-in-time and period reporting for hybrid on-and-off chain fund structures.
- Negated ~0.5% asset loss when bridging by leveraging Circle's <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol" target="blank_">Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol</a>.
- Top 4% of applicants in the YC Fall 2024 cohort. 
-  Architected a fund structure ensuring security and redundancy when transferring assets with multiple signatories.
- Launched the implementation of a decentralized token for accredited investors, allowing Medici's assets to be traded internationally.
- Curated enriched user metrics, in-depth logging & error handling with PoshHog & Setry.
