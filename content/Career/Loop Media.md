<a href="https://loopmedia.app" target="_blank">Loop Media</a> was created to write and read about what’s happening around the world, without algorithms deciding what content you consume or language barriers.

I was inspired by the team’s mission and helped code the website alongside  fantastic developers, designers, and writers. During this time, I was mentored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ira-sanchez/" target="_blank">Ira Sanchez</a>, whose guidance and philosophy were key to my growth as a person and developer.

- Internationalized application by integrating <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/features" target="_blank">DeepL</a>’s LLM to translate articles to any language.
-  Designed and implemented authentication with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, allowing ~100 alpha users to create and interact with articles.
